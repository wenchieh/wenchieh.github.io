* I am a Professor in the School of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at the University of Science and Technology of China. My research focuses on large-scale data mining, trustworthy and secure AI & systems, with an emphasis on machine learning techniques and real-world applications, including graph mining and learning, ML privacy, foundation models, FinTech, and learning systems. My work has been published in top conferences (e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, ICDE, WWW, ACM MM) and journals (e.g., TKDE, TKDD, TOSEM). Additionally, I serve as a program committee member for leading international conferences such as ICML, CVPR, WWW, SIGKDD, NeurIPS, and IJCAI, and as a reviewer for prestigious journals including TKDE, TDSC, TKDD, KAIS, and TNNLS.
